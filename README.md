# SimpleNewTab
This extension replaces the default "New Tab" page with a simpler one on 
Chrome.
It still features shortcuts, and allows to add multiple backgrounds, without
unnecessary clutter.

## How to use
Go to `chrome://extensions/`, enable Developer Mode and click "Load unpacked".
Select this folder, and the extension should be enabled !

When on a new tab, you can add shortcuts using the `Add` button on the left of
the screen. You will be prompted to select a name and a link for your shortcut.
You can also add backgrounds by opening the background menu on the left of the
screen. You will be prompted to add a link to the image, and to choose the
color of the text, to make it readable on different backgrounds.

You can edit and delete both shortcuts and backgrounds by clicking the `...`
that appears when you hover over them.
